# Explanation:
Due to more computation and network calls to the MongoDB server, the web application can support less
max number of concurrent users and RPS. Memory utilization went up a lot, and disk i/o utilization stayed
the same since MongoDB uses memory-mapped files for I/O, and since the benchmark was read-only, there was
no flushing of the mem-mapped files to disk, so disk I/O stayed the same while memory utilization went up
significantly compared to before due to larger data structures for crawled pages stored in MongoDB

- Maximum number of connections that can be handled by the server before any connection drops = 9
- Maximum number of requests per second (RPS) that can be sustained by the server when operating with maximum number of connections = 66

- Percentile of response time or latency per request:
average (50%) = 131 ms
99 percentile = 407 ms

Max % CPU Utilization  = 72%
% Disk I/O Utiliztion = 0%
% Memory Utilization = 88.6%
